Now for the record of achievements during the previous academic year I would like to quote the following club events :-
IE:-
Sync - Till final round
King of the hill - participation
IEEE:-
Co-ordinate - Learn & Implement -till 2nd round
TriWizard tournament - participation
Organised the event Maze solver (made our own bot) during first years fest and probably got a decent participation.

ISTE:-
Powerplay - Highest sponsorship with best marketing team (overall ranking 5th)
Attended Tronix(made easy) workshop – PCB Soldering and Arduino
Transcend - qualified for Arduino WS, Glider WS, Attended final round of Excelsior, 
Trebuchet wars - Participated in final round.
Scotland yard - Participation

CSI:-
INNOVISION:- Jugaad- Finalists (2nd position)
Around the world in 127 minutes - 3rd position
Qualified for Big Fight Final Round - (Not attended the final round though)


Moreover specifying about my goals. My short term goal is get recruited into the club whereas my long term goal is to work for the society’s welfare by applying my knowledge in the field of Electronics because I am a passionate learner and I can work day and nights together to pursue my passion. Moreover I like giving back to the society from which I have gained so much and will keep on learning in the time to come.
","I would like to be a part of IE because i think that i exihibit the following qualities in me which can be an asset for IE as a whole:- 

Hard Working, Self Confident, Punctuality, Honesty, Optimistic and moreover I am a passionate learner who loves challenges. I have always believed in the saying ""Work is Worship"" and that is the reason why i not only work with my brain but also with my heart.","So as mentioned in the previous answer i work from my heart too. So yeah I can get emotional sometimes too and that affects me a lot and my working ability degrades during such a situation.

And one more thing, at certain time it becomes really difficult for me to say ""No"" to people, but i am working on this.","Gadget SIG basically deals with the Electronics field and the implementation of the technology available along with a blend of the knowledge that we have gained theoretically. So Gadget is the best SIG to go for when one wants a perfect blend of fun+tech+application+creativity+much more...

Frankly speaking i enjoy Tronix work so much that i dont even have a track of time once when i sit with my Arduino. Tronix world has loads to offer.

I believe cinema is the best form of art we have presently and so, I watch tons of movies which is probably my favourite passtime.
But what I really, really want to do is actually apply what I've been learning for a long time, now. I've always been told to get the marks and ace the tests but to get an opportunity to practically make use of the theoretical knowledge that I've gained is what I'm longing for. 
I'm a budding E&C engineer and it really fascinates me. I'm really looking forward to inculcating myself into increasing and sharing my knowledge with the tech pros of IE. ","To me, what IE represents is not being content with just 'good' stuff.
The fact that IE's produced brilliant engineers that have reached the top, be it getting into Microsoft or Amazon, is something that tells me, why settle for good when you can be the best?
I am extremely, extremely eager to contribute myself productively to the cause of IE and learn more and more from some of the most technically accomplished seniors there are. 
There's probably nothing better than doing what you love and love what you do, and that's where I see myself wanting to join IE, where there's so much diversity even as a technical club which was so rare to see in my first year and where there is so much more to just organizing events but focusing on making it fruitful.
I'd cherish and thrive if given the opportunity to grow along with this beautiful fraternity. ","Wow, I really had to think this one through. Probably because I pay a lot of attention to detail sometimes and try to be this perfectionist, and that might be a problem if I'm asked to just get the work done on short notice. 
But then again, that might just work well when I really need to analyse something I'm working on. 
So yeah, that's a reason. ","I'm a budding E&C engineer, and there's a reason I chose the field.
The basic concept of the movement of electrons and their manipulation and control being able to achieve so much is simply beautiful. 
After all, it's the little things that matter.
Also, the scope to which I could apply whatever I learn onto practical and more importantly, useful stuff is limitless. 
Since Gadget is a proven SIG in improvising projects in electronics and has the resources, I would love to do what Gadget does.","Just the basic circuits and electronic projects using breadboards, multimeters and ICs and the electronics kit.
I have worked on electromagnetic induction and lit up bulbs/LEDs on completely automated electromagnetic induction.","Maybe not a completely new SIG but something like a sub-division of an SIG. 
This is completely focused on green engineering. Eco friendly and sustainable engineering is something that is huge right now and is in dire need of development. 
Making projects that has its agenda as growth + environment friendly.
After all, its economic growth and sustainability which lead to development.
It's about the greater good for humanity that matters in the end and how it will help people in the long run.","It looks to me like a man is being torn into shreds by this huge horn headed scorpion thing that is ramming its way through him. It looks like you can see his lungs so I'm assuming it has something to do with that, maybe chronic smoking harming him and that being the reason for his ill fate.
","My last words would be : 
""I was late for an IE meeting, I guess I deserve to be late forever now.""


As in, when you die they address you as : Late Mr. XYZ.
