This is Sai Krishna from Hyderabad.

IE will not only help me developing technically but also in furnishing me the knowledge of finance and my satisfying my personal interest of Film Making.","Being reserved is what I always observed in me when I am new to any activity or people.
I fear welcoming new things and taking up big responsibilities alone while I do it good in a team.","After going through the various projects that were taken up under GARAGE SIG,
It interested me because,I would be able to put my knowledge into test by doing things practically and that would develop me technically.",No.,"I would like to propose about having a GAMING SIG .

Adobe Lightroom so that I am able to post process the photos I've taken.Quadcopters have always intrigued me and that's is what next on my mind.I participated in the event King of The Hill.

Projects: We can take problem statements relating to various fields from the factories from manglore and can work on those problem statements.
          We can also come up with problems faced by students and can work upon them.
	  For Eg: Developing the mechanism for a pen pencil. 
		  Problem:Every time we take a new lead for pen pencil, we almost throw 30% of the lead because the mechanism of pen-pencil is such that we cannot use the 30% part of it. In this way from every 10 leads we are able to use only 7. This is a waste of money,graphite and processing cost for leads. So,developing a mechanism for a pen-pencil to overcome this loss can be taken as a part of the project.","The face of a man reflects what he is,
