The basic concept of the movement of electrons and their manipulation and control being able to achieve so much is simply beautiful.

Although currently included in Garage, materials science projects are not given as much importance as Mechanical Engineering projects.

Members of the SIG could undertake relevant projects, possibly along the lines of those undertaken during Engineer.

Further, I particularly loved the Literati event conducted in the even semester which had events like FindMuck and Limelight, a welcome and refreshing break from the tech events of other clubs. The past and upcoming projects of this club also are interesting, including the social work being done in the nearby village.
