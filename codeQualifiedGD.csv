I'm in second year,IT.
I'm from Bangalore.
I'm more of a social person! I love talking and hanging out with my friends.I'm a fun loving person.
I'm a pampered kid and hence I really wanted to do my UG away from home.That's basically why I am here at NITK and I love this place.
If given a chance, I would want to travel.Meet new people,eat different kinds of food and experience the plethora of things that this beautiful world has to offer.

","I'd like to be a part of IE because I had fun participating in the club's events last year.
I couldnt participate in Find Muck and I regret it.
I heard a lot about it from my friends and I thought the event was one brilliant idea.Truly Epic!


","I'd say for not participating in Find Muck
","Code interests me because I've this thing for programming.I was introduced with the basics ofJava in 9th grade and I love the fact that a few lines of code can do something so amazing!
It gives me the power to create something I want to and I love that!
Since the Code SIG is all about programming,I'd like to join this SIG.
And yes, I do have special interest in it.","Yeah,This summer I learnt Python and little bit of Django.
I also learnt front end web development.Helped in a project started by seniors in college.

Also an introvert and book-lover. Life plans- get rich and backpack around the world with me,myself and I. Backup plan-become a librarian. I like playing all sports, listening to rock and instrumental music, and Batman.

","Though I am confused now by which technical events map to which club, its the people in IE who make me want to be a part of it. It appears that IE is a common ground for members of the other nontechnical clubs in college, such as the music club, artists forum and LSD. And to want to be able to regularly interact with such a diverse and talented set of people is appealing. Further, I particularly loved the Literati event conducted in the even semester which had events like FindMuck and Limelight, a welcome and refreshing break from the tech events of other clubs. The past and upcoming projects of this club also are interesting, including the social work being done in the nearby village. I would love to be a part of it all.","Like I mentioned in the above answer, IE is where I think members from various non-tech clubs in college come together. And not being a part of any of these other clubs, I might not be able to contribute significantly to further diversify the club.","Being exposed to only the coding aspect of Computer Science until a year ago, this was was a branch I chose partly because of my interest in programming and partly  because I could not picture myself in any other field. And having just began my second year here, the various non-coding aspects of this branch have not failed to capture my interest. I would love to further explore other topics and hopefully in the process chart out a well-thought out career path for myself.",,"I happened to chance upon the NITK Amateur Writers group on facebook last year, and was blown away by the stories I read there. The description said that it was an IE SIG, and I hope it isn't on it's way out. 
Also, being an animal lover, it's a sad feeling to see how dogs are generally seen to be a menace here, atleast in the girls block. Though I haven't really thought much about it, I'd like to see something being done to improve their conditions, maybe under Vriddhi.","What immortal hand or eye
