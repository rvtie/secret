I like participating in all sorts of events ranging from technical quizzes, workshops, talks to dance and drama. I am an industrious member of Genesis and Team I-care as it is a very fulfilling experience .I am also very passionate in organizing and managing events. I was introduced to micro-controller programming and basic electrical and electronics during my first year,which I enjoyed a lot. In order to pursue my interests further I have applied for a three week internship program in IIIT Hyderabad and I'm also trying to get into an industrial training program for Electrical Engineers in BSP.I'm basically from Raipur but fact that my dad is a govt. servant gave me ample opportunities to travel around and explore different places. I'm a peoples person. I really enjoy meeting and working with a lot of different people. In my first year, I was very keen on getting a branch change to EEE . Considering this fact,the best thing happened to me so far in NITK is that I finally managed to get an internal branch change.

IE provides me a big platform where I can get innumerous chances to enhance my skills, abilities and knowledge and deliver my best to the club.working with IE and its members would help me groom my personality, my scientific outlook as well as my technical and non technical abilities.","I like to make sure that my work is perfect, so I tend to perhaps spend a little too much time checking it.

I believe IE will help me learn a lot of new things which eventually will be helpful for me in the long run. I want to organize the events, have interactions, give in my inputs and at the same time continue my process of learning new stuff.","A tricky question I see..because:
1. I'm too hardworking.
2. I'm too dedicated.
3.I'm too awesome.
4. sometimes i can be too lazy(this is true :P)","Computers interest me a lot. According to me, it is one of the finest inventions mankind has ever had. I studied C++ language in detail in my +2 and that's when I started loving coding. In C++ I learnt about several features like pointers, data structures,OOPs concepts, file handling. I also learnt about SQL and Networking concepts. In the last summer holidays, I learnt about GIT and basic python programming. I also researched on Game Theory which included Pure and Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, Dominated strategies, Saddle points. Apart from this, I know basic Linux commands and work on Netbeans for Java programming which is there in my course. ","For my class 12th boards. I did my CS final project on a topic-'IPL-5'. It was a project made in C++ language which consisted of many features namely ticket booking, auction of players, vote for your favorite player. I had developed back-end also of this project by using file operations in C++. In the last summer hols, I did a project on Game Theory too wherein I learnt about the above stated things. Also I did a report on a Game Theory topic of ""Fair Division"" which dealt with analyzing algorithms or ways to achieve a fair division of goods, entities or any other matter as such. This topic also relates a lot to day-to-day scenarios. ","I always feel that society has given us a lot of things and learnings and hence we  are also entitled to give back to the society. Teaching poor children or any other individual is a beautiful and a very noble initiative. Similar to this on many grounds, I have seen that our mess akkas and other cleaning akkas are not very well versed in hindi and english languages. This sometimes poses a problem for the non-kannadiga students who are unable to communicate with them. Hence, if we can hold an initiative to teach them basic hindi/english, it can turn out to be boon for both them and us. Secondly, in this process we could also make some of them literate who were not before.","The first thought which comes to my mind, seeing this pic is a human figure riding on a scooter. The scooter also is not some normal scooter, but another kind with wings attached to it. The person seems to be in utmost hurry and all the mud and other stuff is flying off as he's driving.
